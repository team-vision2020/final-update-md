## Introduction
The problem of filter identification mirrors closely that identification of camera source based on camera noise and there are several piece of literature regarding this topic. While there have been several paper on this topic previously using traditional expert feature based techniques [need references], we particularly follow convolutional neural network based approaches that have shown good results in the past two years, specifically
